introit: 'O Lord my God, in thy loving-kindness and mercy have I trusted;
    and my heart is joyful in thy salvation: I will sing unto the Lord, because
    he hath dealt so lovingly with me. How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord,
    for ever: how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? Glory be to the Father,
    and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is
    now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: O GOD, the strength of all them that put their trust in thee, mercifully
    accept our prayers; and because through the weakness of our mortal nature
    we can do no good thing without thee, grant us the help of thy grace,
    that in keeping of thy commandments we may please thee, both in will and
    deed; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
epistle_ref: 1 St. John 4:7-end
epistle: 'BELOVED, let us love one another: for love is of God, and every
    one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth
    not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God towards
    us, because that God sent his only-begotten Son into the world, that we
    might live through him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that
    he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved,
    if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. No man hath seen
    God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love
    is perfected in us. Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us;
    because he hath given us of his Spirit. And we have seen, and do testify,
    that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whosoever
    shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he
    in God. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God
    is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
    Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day
    of judgement; because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear
    in love; but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath torment:
    he that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first
    loved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar:
    for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love
    God whom he hath not seen? And this commandment have we from him, that
    he who loveth God love his brother also.'

gospel_ref: St. Luke 16:19-end
gospel: 'THERE was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine
    linen, and fared sumptuously every day. And there was a certain beggar
    named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate full of sores, and desiring
    to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man''s table: moreover
    the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass, that the beggar
    died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham''s bosom. The rich man
    also died, and was buried: and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments,
    and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and
    said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may
    dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented
    in this flame. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy life-time
    receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now
    he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And besides all this, between
    us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they who would pass from
    hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from
    thence. Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest
    send him to my father''s house: for I have five brethren; that he may
    testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. Abraham
    saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
    And he said, Nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead,
    they will repent. And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the
    prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.'

    for unto thee will I make my prayer.'
communion: 'I will speak of all thy marvellous works; I will be glad, and
