introit: 'They cried unto thee, O Lord, in the time of their misery and trouble:
    And thou didst hear them from thy holy heaven, alleluia, alleluia. Rejoice
    in the Lord, O ye righteous: for it becometh well the just to be thankful.
    Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was
    in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O ALMIGHTY God, whom truly to know is everlasting life: Grant us
    perfectly to know thy Son Jesus Christ to be the way, the truth, and the
    life; that, following the steps of thy holy Apostles, Saint Philip and
    Saint James, we may stedfastly walk in the way that leadeth to eternal
    life; through the same thy Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'
epistle_ref: St. James 1:1-12
epistle: 'JAMES, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve
    tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. My brethren, count it all
    joy when ye fall into divers temptations; knowing this, that the trying
    of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work,
    that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. If any of you lack
    wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth
    not, and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering;
    for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind,
    and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing
    of the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways. Let the
    brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted; but the rich in that
    he is made low; because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
    For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the
    grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of
    it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. Blessed
    is the man that endureth temptation; for when he is tried, he shall receive
    the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.'
gat: Alleluia Proper
alleluia: 'Alleluia. Alleluia. The righteous man shall stand in great boldness:
    before the face of such as have afflicted him. Alleluia. Did not our heart
    burn within us: while he talked with us by the way concerning Jesus. Alleluia.'
gospel_ref: St. John 14:1-4
gospel: 'AND Jesus said unto his disciples, Let not your heart be troubled;
    ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father''s house are many
    mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a
    place for you: and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,
    and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also. And
    whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord,
    we know not whither thou goest, and how can we know the way? Jesus saith
    unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
    Father but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also:
    and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto
    him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him,
    Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?
    He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew
    us the Father? Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father
    in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself; but the
    Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me, that I am
    in the Father, and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very works''
    sake. Verily, verily I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works
    that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do;
    because I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that
    will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask
    any thing in my name, I will do it.'
offertory: 'O Lord, the very heavens shall praise thy wondrous works: and
    thy truth in the congregation of the saints, alleluia, alleluia.'
communion: 'Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known
    me, Philip: he that hath seen me hath seen the Father, alleluia. Believest
    thou not that I am in the Father: and the Father in me, alleluia, alleluia.'
