introit: 'Arise, O Lord, wherefore sleepest thou? awaken, and cast us not
    away for ever: wherefore hidest thou thy countenance, and forgettest our
    adversity and misery? our belly cleaveth unto the ground; arise, and save
    us, O Lord, our helper, and our deliverer. O God, we have heard with our
    ears: our fathers have told us. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
    and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
    be: world without end. Amen.'
collect: 'O LORD God, who seest that we put not our trust in any thing that
    we do: Mercifully grant that by thy power we may be defended against all
    adversity; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.'

epistle: 'YE suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise. For ye suffer
    if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of
    you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face. I speak as
    concerning reproach, as though we had been weak: howbeit, whereinsoever
    any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. Are they Hebrews? so
    am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am
    I. Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I am more: in labours
    more abundant; in stripes above measure; in prisons more frequent; in
    deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one;
    thrice was I beaten with rods; once was I stoned; thrice I suffered shipwreck;
    a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeyings often; in perils
    of waters; in perils of robbers; in perils by mine own countrymen; in
    perils by the heathen; in perils in the city; in perils in the wilderness;
    in perils in the sea; in perils among false brethren; in weariness and
    painfulness; in watchings often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often;
    in cold and nakedness; besides those things that are without, that which
    cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches. Who is weak, and I
    am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? If I must needs glory, I
    will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities. The God and Father
    of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that
    I lie not.'

gradual: 'Let the nations know that thou, whose name is Jehovah: art only
    the Most Highest over all the earth. O my God, make them like unto a wheel:
    and as the stubble before the wind.'
tract: 'Thou hast moved the land, O Lord, and divided it: heal the sores thereof,
    for it shaketh. That they may triumph because of the truth. That thy Beloved
    may be delivered.'
gospel_ref: St. Luke 8:4-15
gospel: 'WHEN much people were gathered together, and were come to him out
    of every city, he spake by a parable: A sower went out to sow his seed;
    and as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and it was trodden down, and
    the fowls of the air devoured it. And some fell upon a rock, and as soon
    as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. And
    some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.
    And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundred-fold.
    And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear,
    let him hear. And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable
    be? And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom
    of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and
    hearing they might not understand. Now the parable is this: The seed is
    the word of God. Those by the way-side are they that hear; then cometh
    the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should
    believe, and be saved. They on the rock are they which, when they hear,
    receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe,
    and in time of temptation fall away. And that which fell among thorns
    are they which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares,
    and riches, and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.
    But that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart,
    having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.'
offertory: 'O hold thou up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip
    not: incline thine ear t me, and hearken unto my words: show thy marvellous
    loving-kindness, O Lord; thou that art the Saviour of them which put their
    trust in thee.'
communion: 'I will go to the altar of God: even unto the God of my joy and
    gladness.'
